# Induction motor fault analysis
Induction engine faults diagnosis and classification are essential aspects of industrial systems maintenance and operation. This work proposes a machine learning approach aimed at diagnosing common motor faults such as short circuit, open circuit, and rotor bar faults based on simulation data of an induction motor using MATLAB SIMULINK. The data collected included three phase currents in the stator and rotors and magnetic torque readings. In particular, the models used were K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, CatBoost and a deep learning model. 
This work on detection of faults in induction motors (preparing a dataset of 2,71,580 data) by offering a qualitative assessment of the available ensemble as well as deep learning strategies indicating that real time fault monitoring and classification is best achieved using deep learning models.
